                    When I first got into computer programming I was 11 or something like that,
                    I watched some Html and css vids and I just thought that wow it's so cool,
                    I can build something on my own, I can turn my imaginations to reality with this, and these kind of
                    thoughts.

                    Ok, Back to the main subject
                    I went to learn Python, It was so fun i couldn't resist against my love to programming, I did so
                    many cool projects,
                    Discord Bots, Some weird games and ...
                    <br>
                    Then I started learning C, But i felt enough comfortable to use documentation instead of buying a
                    course or something,
                    Yeah, I hated C, C++. These are really good languages but I just don't like them.
                    <br>
                    So I decided to learn Django.
                    I used a free course, and after 3 months I finished it, I was so happy and i wanted to make
                    experience so i did so many projects
                    like a weblog, A shopping website, a todo app with django and ajax, Some docker django projects, and
                    some weirdos
                    <br>
                    After a while i learned Js and Ts using documentations, and after a year or something I'm feeling
                    pretty good about it.
                    When i Mastered Js, I went to Learn React,
                    I did some cool projects with react, <a href="https://github.com/BGOPC/bgopc-chatapp">React with
                        Firebase</a> or
                    <a href="http://github.com/BGOPC/house-party">React with DRF</a>
                    A while ago I decided to learn next but cause of the exams i couldn't.
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-blue-900">
